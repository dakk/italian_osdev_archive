This file contains the directory organization of the various document
collected (mostly to be created :-):

KERNEL-HACKERS:
This directory contains various informations about the kernel itself,
mechanism, politics, data, and other informations dedicated to people who
want to know how and why OSSO works this way.

DEVELOPERS:
This sections is specific to people who want to write some programs, like
servers (osso drivers), that are not specifically kernel-related, but need
some info about OS organization, etc...

PROGRAMMERS:
This is the last, and for all, non-considered section.
In this directory you will find informations about OSSO programming in
general, but for now OSSO hasn't a defined structure, so this has to
remain empty for a while.

DRAFTS-IT:
This is the OSSO-STAFF service dir, where we put info, doubts, and the
many things we have rounding in our minds. This probably will ever be in
italian, cause our team is now composed by italian people, and it's more
practical to use. Sorry, but it's only for internal use...

Disclaimer: if you have read this, you probably understand why the last
section is in italian... :-)
HAVE FUN!
