/* This 2-3 heap implementation uses the same kind of pointer structure for
 * nodes as the Fibonacci heap does.
 *
 * This 2-3 heap implementation was designed for use with Dijkstra's single
 * source shortest path algorithm.  Nodes have a vertex number and a key.
 * This source code could easily be modified to use a pointer (void *) to any
 * structure, rather than using vertex numbers as an index.

/*** Structure Types ***/

/* The structure type for 2-3 heap nodes.
 *
 * The pointer `parent' points to a nodes parent, and `child' points to the
 * highest dimension child in a circular doubly linked list of child nodes.
 * The circular doubly linked list of child nodes is maintained using the
 * sibling pointers `left' and `right'.  The parent pointer of root nodes is
 * NULL.
 *
 * The remaining structure fields are:
 * `dim'       - the nodes dimension.
 * `key'       - the nodes key.
 * `vertex_no' - the number of the graph vertex that the node corresponds to.
 *               Vertex numbering in the graph should be:
 *               1, 2, 3, ... max_vertex.
 *
 * In this implementation, dimensioning of nodes begins at zero, so the
 * dimension of a single node with no children is zero.

/* The structure type for a 2-3 heap.
 *
 * trees - An array of pointers to trees at root level in the heap.  Entry i
 *         in the array points to the root node of a tree that has nodes of
 *         dimension i on the main trunk.
 * nodes - An array of pointers to nodes in the heap.  Nodes are indexed
 *         according to their vertex number.  This array can then be used to
 *         look up the node for corresponding to a vertex number, and is
 *         useful when freeing space taken up by the heap.
 * max_nodes - The maximum number of nodes allowed in the heap.
 * max_trees - The maximum number of trees allowed in the heap (calculated from
 *             max_nodes).
 * n     - The current number of nodes in the heap.
 * value - The binary value represented by trees in the heap.
 *         By maintaining this it is easy to keep track of the maximum rank
 *         tree in the heap.
 * key_comps - can be used for experimental purposes when counting the number
 *             of key comparisons.
