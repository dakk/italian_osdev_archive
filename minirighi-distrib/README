- What is minirighi? -
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minirighi is a multi-threading open-source operating system written
for didactic purpose. It has been written from scratch and it is
compatible with POSIX.

It works only on IA-32 architecture and, for now, it is not very
portable.

The main feature of Minirighi is its light kernel, easy to read
from all, simply by analyzing the sources, unlike many other
open-source kernels.

Thanks to this facility it can be used for didactic purposes, to
deepen the OS development techniques or the study of particular
architectures, from the newbies or students to the most expert
users.

From this point of view, Minirighi, can be a profit tool both for
those people that want to test his/her own high-level algorithms,
since the fundamental routines have already been written; but can
also be useful for the driver developers, that can improve the
already existing routines and test these in a relatively simple
system.

Everyone will be able to easily modify the sources to adapt Minirighi
to its own purposes; for example it could be adapted to real-time
systems, without write a great amount of code, since the operators to
manage time constraints and ISR are already present.

The lightness and the modularity of the kernel will also make it
useful for the development of systems devoted to particular devices
or technologies, that don't require heavy user-friendly or graphical
interfaces.
Besides, thanks to its modularity and lightness, it will easily be
adaptable to the new technologies.

All of this code was written by Andrea Righi,
with a lot of help from various sources, tutorials, forums, etc...

The project Minirighi has started by an OS examimation at the
university where I study (Universita' degli Studi di Siena) and I
will be happy if many other students/hackers came to enjoy with
this code. :)

There is also a forum (only in italian) where you can ask your
questions:

If you have any feedback, bug reports, opinions or offers of help
then feel free to email me at the address above.

Happy hacking with new OS techniques!!!
