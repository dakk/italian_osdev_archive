- Files you need -
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	minirighi32-x.xx.xx.tar.bz2

	NOTE: the 'x' represent the version.


- Other things you need for Minirighi32 -
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GCC version 3.2.2 or later;
BINUTILS package version 2.13.90 or later;
MTOOLS version 3.9.8 or later for automatic installation;
GRUB 0.92 or later to load the kernel.


- Quick start -
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to test Minirighi on a real PC you have to do these
following steps:

1) Unpack the sources as follow:

	tar xvjf minirighi32-x.xx.xx.tar.bz2

   where the 'x' represent the version of the image.

2) Enter in the toplevel directory of minirighi distribution:

	cd minirighi-distrib

3) Run:

	make world

4) If you want to create a bootable floppy disk, insert a disk
   into the floppy and run:

	make disk

   Attention!!! Every data in the floppy disk will be lost!!!

5) Verify that the image has been written successfully by trying to
   access the disk. It should contain a valid FAT file system.

6) Reboot the PC.

After this, the GRUB loader should appear, giving you the option
of booting minirighi. Choose minirighi option, press Enter, wait for it
to load the kernel and with a bit of luck you can enjoy yourself
with minirighi :-)


- Compiling the source code: explanation of steps -
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a short explanation about every step to build a complete
working release of minirighi. Instead of the "make world" directive
you can compile a new kernel also running these following commands
in this order:

<Kernel>
make config		<-- to configure the kernel

make dep		<-- find dependencies for all C files

make clean		<-- clean all the previous objects and
			    configuration files
			    (NOTE: this is a very important step!!!)

make all		<-- make the kernel

make install		<-- create a bootable floppy disk image
			    with GRUB and minirighi
<Applications>
make apps		<-- make the applications for minirighi

make apps_install	<-- install the applications into the floppy
			    disk image

<Extras>
make disk		<-- copy the floppy disk image into a real
			    floppy disk in /dev/fd0

make isocd		<-- make a bootable ISO cd image

The "make world" directive performs every of the previous steps except
the "make disk" and "make isocd" (the extras).
If you want to create a working bootable floppy or a bootable iso cd
image you have to use these commands explicitly.

After you have created your kernel you can free up disk space running
"make clean" again. This directive will remove all the object files
created during the compilation.

There are also other directives:

make distclean		<-- perform a more accurate clean

make doc		<-- make the minirighi HTML documentation

make backup		<-- make a backup of the current
			    distribution... very useful!!!
Enjoy,
	Andrea.
