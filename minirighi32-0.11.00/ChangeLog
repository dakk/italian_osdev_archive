	* include/kernel/cow.h, os/kernel/cow.c
	Added COW interface to keep track about shared pages (between forked tasks and their father).

2004-08-25 Andrea Righi
	* os/arch/i386/kernel/paging.c, os/arch/i386/kernel/exceptions.c:
	Added the page fault handler for COW pages.

	Added SSE / SSE2 extensions.
	Added improvements for K7 and AthlonXP processors.

2004-08-24 (BRANCH 0.10.04-rc1) Andrea Righi
	* os/drivers/dma/dma.c, os/drivers/floppy/floppy.c:
	No mutual exclusion for the DMA controller <- bug fixed.
	This problem caused errors and data corruption in concurrent accesses to
	floppy disk blocks for read/write operations.
	Changes in functions fdc_rw(); added routines lock_dma_controller() and unlock_dma_controller().

2004-08-23 Andrea Righi
	* os/network/eth.c:
	Fixed a very *dangerous* bug: deadlock during the reception of ARP and IP packets at the same time.
	Changed functions: to_eth_layer(), recv_eth_packet(), recv_arp_packet().

	* apps/src/ping/*:
	Added a simple user application to translate strings into the morse code.

2004-08-22 Andrea Righi
	* os/network/icmp.c:
	Removed the ping code from the kernel; can be replaced by a user-level application.
	Changed to_icmp_layer() routine to handle ICMP echo request packets.

	* os/network/ip.c:
	Added function get_host_net() to return network address.
	Changed ip_packet_filter() routine.
	Changed send_ip_packet() to handle correctly loopback and broadcast packets.
	Added ip_sendto() function: the standard interface for raw IP packets.
	Changed ip_recvfrom() function: now returns the IP packet without the IP header.

	* os/network/socket.c:
	Added raw ip socket implementation - changed sys_recvfrom(), sys_sendto(), sys_socket().

2004-08-21 Andrea Righi
	* include/net/*.h:
	Separated the kernel headers from the user headers for each network layer.
	Created kernel files in include/kernel/net/*.h.

2004-08-20 Andrea Righi
	* os/network/eth.c:
	Funtion ifconfig() modified: set 0.0.0.0 as the host IP address when network goes down.

	* os/network/ip.c:
	host_ip and host_netmask are initialized to 0 (this means that network is down).
	send_ip_packet and ip_recvfrom check if the network is down before sending / receiving packets.

	* os/network/icmp.c:
	Print if the network is down (and in this case report 0.0.0.0 for this host IP address).

2004-08-19 (BRANCH 0.10.03) Andrea Righi
	* os/kernel/elf32.c:
	Fixed bug #944334 (now the .bss section is correctly zeroed after a file is loaded in memory).

	* os/fs/fat/fat12.c:
	Fixed bug #941856 (mutual exclusion problems to get the size of a file).

	* os/network/ip.c, os/network/icmp.c:
	Fixed some errors that occurred when pinging to the loopback IP address.

2004-08-15 Andrea Righi
	* os/network/ip.c, os/network/icmp.c:
	Added the support for the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1).
	Created a standard socket interface also for ICMP sockets.

	* apps/src/morse/*:
	Added a simple user application to translate strings into the morse code.

2004-08-14 Andrea Righi
	* os/network/socket.c:
	Created a standard interface for network functions to support user-level sockets
	(for now only UDP sockets are available).

	* os/arch/i386/kernel/syscall.S:
	Added sys_socket, sys_closesocket, sys_bind, sys_recvfrom and sys_sendto system calls.

	* apps/src/socket/*:
	Created a simple UDP chat server to test sockets.

	* os/driver/floppy/floppy.c:
	Added the floppy cache for recently used blocks.
	Improved low-level routines for read and write operations.

	* os/fs/fat/fat12.c:
	Added sync, mount, umount routines.

	* os/shell/shell.c:
	Added sync, mount, umount commands.

2004-04-21 Andrea Righi

	* os/driver/floppy/floppy.c:
	Fixed deadlock bug.

	* os/network/eth.c:
	Fixed deadlock bug.
