/* A node in the 2-3 tree maintains two keys and three child pointers.
 * A node in the 2-3 tree has between two and three children, except for the
 * special case where it is the root node of a tree containing only 0 or 1
 * nodes.  When a nodes has two children its left and middle child pointers are
 * used, and its right child pointer is NULL.  For a node which has three
 * children all child pointer are used.
 *
 * Data items in a two-three tree are all stored at the lowest level of the
 * tree as leaf items.  A node whose children are leaf items has its link_kind
 * field set to LEAF_LINK.  If the node's children are other nodes, then its
 * link_kind parameter will be set to INTERNAL_LINK.
 *
 * A node in the 2-3 tree has two keys:
 *    key_item1 - points to the item with the smallest key among items in the
 *                nodes middle-child subtree.  For the special case where a
 *                root node contains only 0 or 1 nodes, key_item1 is NULL.
 *    key_item2 - points to the item with the smallest key among items in the
 *                nodes right-child subtree.  If there is no right child, then
 *                key_item2 is NULL.
 *
 * The properties of child trees of a node in a 2-3 tree are:
 *     - data items i stored under the right-child subtree have
 *       key(key_item2) <= key(i).
 *     - data items i stored under the middle-child subtree have
 *       key(key_item1) <= key(i) < key(key_item2).
 *     - data items i stored under the left-child subtree have
 *       key(i) < key(key_item2).
